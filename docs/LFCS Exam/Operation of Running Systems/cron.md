# Example of job definition:

# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
```

- Visit `man 5 cron` for explanation
- `/var/spool/cron` directory where cron checks for user jobs

During the exam, you can have a handy way of 

```bash
cat /etc/crontab >> /var/spool/cron/$USER
```

## cron.allow and cron.deny files

- If `/etc/cron.deny` exists it will implicity allow users to 
run `/etc/crontab -e` and will disallow listed users.

- If `cron.allow` exists it will only allow user listed in the file and explicity 
disallow user not listed from  running `crontab -e`

- If neither file exist only the  root user is allowed to run crontab -e

| .                         | cron.deny exists                           | cron.deny does not exist                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| cron.allow exist          | only user listed in cron.allow are allowed | only user listed in cron.allow are allowed |
| cron.allow does not exist | user listed in cron.deny aren't allowed    | only root user can use crontab -e          |


## Examples

```bash
*/15 12 * * * logger "doing something"
```
This would run it every 15 minutes starting from 12:00 o'clock (24 hour format) till 13:00.

So, the task would run at `12:00`, `12:15`, `12:30` and  `12:45`
 

```bash
15 12 15 * Fri logger "doing something"
```
runs the command on the 15th of every month, and every Friday at 12:15 

!!! Note 
    When the Day of month and Day of week fields are both other than *,
    the command is executed when either of these two fields are satisfied.
